This project has been made as my master thesis.
It was intended as a 3D fighting game where players are controlled with motion capture based on USB camera image. My friend is still working on the motion capture system, so at this point players are controlled traditionally - with keyboard.

The game is written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering.
Both physical and graphical engines were written from scratch.
Most of the documentation is currently available only in Polish.

The game may be compiled both under Windows and Linux. Executable packages contain '/fighter.exe' file for Windows and '/fighter' for Linux.
Note that execute rights must be granted for '/fighter' file.
Read [Compilation and Execution](CompilationAndExecution.md) topic for more info.

For keyboard reference check [Keyboard Reference](ComBoard.md) site.
